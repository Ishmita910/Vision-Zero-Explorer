### Introduction to Vision Zero 
#### General history and outlines of Vision Zero
 
Vision Zero was first implemented in Sweden in 1997, with a set goal to reach a transportation network with no fatalities or serious injuries with a main principle ‘Life and health can never be exchanged for other benefits within society’, which is to create and enforce safety, targeting on different modes such as Pedestrian, cyclist and vehicle. Furthermore, Vision Zero was adopted by a number of countries and cities with: such as Netherlands, United Kingdom and recent cities within the United State such as Boston, San Francisco, California and finally New York City. 
In 2014, Mayor de Blasio released a New York City Vision Zero Action plan, a 63 steps-disciplined approach to achieve the goals of Vision Zero. The goals are to reduce the numbers of traffic eliminates within fatalities by combining three main characteristics elements to assure safety:  process and development enforcement, education and engineering to make sure that New York City is working toward achieving Vision Zero. 
NYC Vision Zero
NYC Vision Zero includes the collaborations some of the major Transportation associate agencies in the city and these are the following: City Hall, Police Department, Department of Transportation, Taxi and Limousine Commission, Department of Citywide Administrative Services and last but not least is the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. These departments will be working together setting up roles and regulations to improve the safety of the action plan. The plan will include the following more enforcement against speeding with more precinct-level personnel another aspect is adding personnel at the Highway Division of the NYPD. Also to redesigning intersections and expanding upon the slow zone in residential neighborhood and school zone. Most importantly and effectively is the increase in the number of speed humps, speed boards, red light and speed cameras to make sure the vehicles are following the rules and regulations.
This is a summary of the goals and plans that the DOT desire to achieve and apply throughout the city:
Department of Transportation
1.Implement safety engineering improvements at 50 intersections and corridors
2.Create 25 new arterial slow zones
3.Implement eight new neighborhood slow zones
4.Install speed cameras at 20 new authorized locations
5.Install 250-speed bumps, including in neighborhood slow zones
6.Enhance street lighting at 1,000 intersections
7.Enhance maintenance of street markings
8.Install traffic signals where needed for speed control via coordinated arterial signal time
9.Additional street reconstruction safety projects
10.Survey national and international best practices to expand potential strategies
11.Hold workshops for major street design projects
12.Undertake a high-quality ad campaign aimed at reducing speeding, failure-to-yield and other forms of reckless driving
13.Increase extent of “Choices” anti-DUI campaign
14.Double number of programmable speed boards for intensive education/enforcement initiative
15.Make effective, age-appropriate safety curriculum available to schools throughout the city
16.Partner with senior centers to increase communication and get specific feedback from aging New Yorkers about street safety improvements
17.Increase the number and visibility of hands-on safety demonstrations
18.Add safety flyers and messaging in DOT mailings such as Alternate Side Parking regulations and construction permits

The Purpose of Data Analysis and visualizations  
Our analysis will visualize the data to focus on the areas with respect to the impacted area and needs updated mitigation measures. The visualization’s data will be mainly used by traffic engineers and city planner, all related fields.  The visualization will include charts and maps to identify the area where Vision Zero needs improvements in terms of both decreasing the numbers injuries and fatalities. The result of the data will emphasize on whether Vision Zero is effective throughout the five Borough, to also understand the climax of Vision Zero and to provide new mitigation measure to improve upon the action items. The data visualization will include accident type classified with respect to the needed development to Vision Zero. The visualized data will incorporate the progress of vision zero based on the peak hour, accident type and location. In the domain of finding new mitigation measures, updating data analysis and allocating new funding for areas with higher number of accidents based on the categories of the accident mode. Also the finding will aim on the priority of Vision Zero. The visualization will aim on the classification to facilities the type of accidents and fatalities to assent in finding mitigation that best fits the location and the cause the level of effectiveness of Vision Zero. The main goal for the data visualizations to organize the data collection and to understand the area of mitigation measures
        

 

Accident count per year and per Borough: 
Based on the Data Visualize using the collection used from NYC open data, dated on 2012 through 2018, which is more accurate information using based years of 2013-2017; to identify the development after the NYC implementation of Vision Zero in 2014. As result of the data collection, we comprehend that vision zero is making a slow base improvement in terms of lowering the total number of accidents per year and per-borough. As an outcome of the data visualization, we perceive that Brooklyn, Manhattan and followed by Queens, have the highest number of accidents; bearing in mind that these boroughs have more dense compare to both Bronx and Staten Island. 
Finding and Mitigation: Brooklyn has the highest number of Accidents there must be a number mitigation measure: 
1.	Secure funding for continuous improvements that exceeds the 2024
2.	Create more capital projects within the highest number of both injures and fatalities 
3.	Conduct a monitoring plan of population growth in terms of street improvements 
4.	Update the enforcement with new action items that includes both cyclists and pedestrian 
5.	Adopt new engineering method to improve street geometry 
 

The total number of persons injured that includes all type of modes, as a result of Vision Zero we see the total number of the decrease by an approximate of 3000 injuries over the course of three years in Brooklyn, which has the highest number of person’s injuries followed by Queens and the results indicates an increase of the number injuries in the year of 2016. Followed by Manhattan, Bronx, and with the lowest number Staten Island      
Finding and Outcome: 
The analysis indicates that the need of focus on Brooklyn Borough is needed, where vision Zero is making a slow progress of decreasing the number of injuries over course of four years since the implementation of Vision Zero in 2014. To provide new mitigations, it is required an overview of the past procedure and regulation of implementing Vision Zero.  
The Visualization guide to find the following mitigation measures:  
1.	Vision Zero must include human error in both planning, engineering and enforcement 
2.	A close study based on both characteristic of streets and culture 
3.	Working closely with all type of vehicles engineers and developers to make sure the safety of vehicles fits with the goal of street safety. 
  
 
 

The goal of Vision Zero is to have zero fatalities citywide, aimed to be reached by the year of 2024. Based on the Number of person killed and the outcome to vision zero there is a decrease of number of killed in the boroughs of Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island, with a clear understanding that each borough has different numbers of the total of killed. 
Outcome and finding  
The outcome for Brooklyn after the implementation of Vision Zero maintain the same prior to the implementation of the Vision Zero, and did not include any improvements for years of 2014 and 2015 with a measure decrease in the year of 2016 and with an increase in the year of 2017. It will be necessary to update the mitigation measures to focus more on the following
1.	Making sure that mobility is safe from the beginning, for example Brooklyn and Manhattan street infrastructure cannot handle the capacity of both vehicles and pedestrians; vision zero must be aware of that point, to find a result without comprise to traffic safety.
2.	  Human error must be factored for example j-walking or midblock crossing must be factored in the enforcement also backseat seatbelt must be enforcement must be included. 

 
The bar chart above shows the number of pedestrians injured before and after Vision Zero. In 2013, in the Bronx, the number of pedestrian injuries was about 1,700 pedestrians, It can be seen that the number of pedestrians injures in 2014 when Vision Zero was introduced, the numbers fell slightly from about 1,700 to 1,500 and from 2015 to 2016 the numbers were very similar to 2014 with a slight decrease having about 1,300 injuries. However, in 2017 the injuries have increased slightly reaching about 1,400 pedestrians. Brooklyn and Manhattan had the same trend where a slight decrease is shown, in 2013 it was about 3,800 and in 2014 it reached about 3,300 injuries and the trend follows for 2015, 2016 and 2017. However, in Queens the numbers of injuries fluctuate. In Staten Island, there is slight decrease of injuries after the introduction of Vision Zero. Overall, we can see a clear downward trend in the number of injuries after the introduction of Vision Zero throughout the five boroughs.    
Outcomes and Finding 
Finding and Mitigation: Brooklyn has the highest number of Accidents there must be a number mitigation measure: 

1.	Making sure that mobility is safe from the beginning, for example Brooklyn and Manhattan street infrastructure cannot handle the capacity of both vehicles and pedestrians; vision zero must be aware of that point, to find a result without comprise to traffic safety. 
2.	  Human error must be factored for example j-walking or midblock crossing must be factored in the enforcement also backseat seatbelt must be enforcement must be included. 









 
The number of pedestrians killed in the Bronx and Queens show a similar trend of having a decrease in number of pedestrians killed after the implementation of Vision Zero. However, in Manhattan and Brooklyn we see the numbers fluctuate not showing the outcome of Vision Zero. In Staten Island due to the very low of numbers of pedestrians killed there is no significant change.  
Outcomes and Finding 
Finding and Mitigation: Brooklyn has the highest number of Accidents there must be a number mitigation measure: 
1.	Implement new enforcements plan to the pedestrians with respect to the population growth and mindset/culture. For example, in Staten Island the mindset to walking is not very common as much as driving. 
2.	  Human error must be factored for example j-walking or midblock crossing must be factored in the enforcement also backseat seatbelt must be enforcement must be included. 
3.	Using new technologies such as vibration pedestrian ramps and sidewalks audio effects the awareness of pedestrians to the surrounding environments.
 



The bar chart illustrates the number of cyclists injured. In Bronx, Staten Island and Queens there is no significant change occurring after the implementation of Vision Zero. In Brooklyn, the numbers of cyclists injured fluctuates, where we cannot conclude the true effects of Vision Zero. Lastly, in Manhattan we see a slight decrease of cyclists injured. Based on the data collection, there is an improvement in the numbers of cyclist injuries, however, it seems the improvement is a slow progress over the period of four years.

Outcomes and Finding 
Finding and Mitigation: Brooklyn has the highest number of Accidents there must be a number mitigation measure: 
1.	Implement new enforcements plan to the cyclists, and issuing summons 
2.	Secure funding safer bike routes citywide  
 





 

The number of cyclist killed in the bar graph above does not show a pattern throughout the 5 boroughs. In the Bronx, there was an increase in the number of cyclist killed in 2015 after the introduction of Vision Zero and then it decreases in 2016 and increases again in 2017. In Manhattan and Queens, the numbers fluctuate, concluding the insignificance of vision Zero in regard to the number of cyclists killed. In Brooklyn, there is an increase of cyclists killed in 2016 and 2017. 

Outcomes and Finding 
Finding and Mitigation: Brooklyn has the highest number of Accidents there must be a number mitigation measure: 
1.	Human error must be factored for example j-walking or midblock crossing must be factored in the enforcement also backseat seatbelt must be enforcement must be included. 
2.	Implement new enforcements plan to the cyclists, and issuing summons 
3.	Secure funding safer bike routes citywide  


 


Vision Zero mainly focus on regulating vehicles behavior, with Brooklyn having the highest number of motorist injures in Brooklyn followed by Queens. The results of Vision Zero in Brooklyn the numbers of Motorist injuries were lowered in the years of 2015 to 2017. Nonetheless, the numbers of injuries in Queens increased from 2015 to 2016, for this year Vision Zero was not effective. The results of this data collection indicates that Vision Zero was not adequate and the improvements measure did not make a big difference throughout the course of 
Outcomes and Finding 
Finding and Mitigation: Brooklyn has the highest number of Accidents there must be a number mitigation measure: 

1.	provide an updated survey of the increase of number of vehicles per-year and to provide new mitigation measures 
2.	Making sure that mobility is safe from the beginning, for example Brooklyn and Manhattan street infrastructure cannot handle the capacity




 


The number of motorist killed indicates that Vision Zero is effective decrease as shown in the bar graph. The data collection show that Brooklyn followed by Queens with the highest number of Killed. However, for Queens there is no improvement for they years of 2014 and 2016. Vision Zero mainly focus on regulating vehicles behavior.
